Welcome to my personal page! Have a look around.



I am since November 2020 a PhD student at the [**PMMH laboratory**](https://www.pmmh.espci.fr/?-Le-laboratoire-) (ESPCI - PSL, Université Paris Cité & Sorbonne Université).
I am part of the **Biomimetics and Fluid-Structure Interaction team** (aka [BIOMIM](https://www.pmmh.espci.fr/Biomimetics-and-Fluid-Structure-Interaction)), under the supervision of [Benjamin Thiria](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=Ho7KLfUAAAAJ&hl=fr) and [Ramiro Godoy-Diana](https://blog.espci.fr/ramiro/).

You can find my full CV [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/docs/CV_B.LAFOUX_en_mar20.pdf).

## Research interests

I am generally interested in fluid mechanics and fluid-structure interactions, in particular animal swimming and flying, geophysical flows, bio-inspired propulsion and energy-harvesting, mostly with an experimental approach. I am also curious about active matter and collective motion phenomena. I am inspired by beauty and aesthetics in scientific research.
