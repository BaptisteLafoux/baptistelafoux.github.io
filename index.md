<mark>Welcome to my personal page!</mark>

**I am open to job opportunities starting Sep 2024, as R&D engineer or data-scientist, in the field of oceanography or climate science.** 

I am currently realizing a long term personal project, post-thesis : after renovating it, I am sailing accros Europe on my 8m-boat *Petit Bouillon*, from the Franch Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean Sea. This 6 months trip is coming to an end in Sep. 2024. 

I was from November 2020 to December 2023 a PhD student at the [**PMMH laboratory**](https://www.pmmh.espci.fr/?-Le-laboratoire-) (ESPCI - PSL, Université Paris Cité & Sorbonne Université).
I was part of the **Biomimetics and Fluid-Structure Interaction team** (aka [BIOMIM](https://www.pmmh.espci.fr/Biomimetics-and-Fluid-Structure-Interaction)), under the supervision of [Benjamin Thiria](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=Ho7KLfUAAAAJ&hl=fr) and [Ramiro Godoy-Diana](https://blog.espci.fr/ramiro/).

## Scientific interests

I am generally interested in fluid mechanics, fluid-structure interactions, in particular geophysical flows, bio-inspired propulsion and energy-harvesting, with an experimental and data-driven approach. I am also curious about active matter and collective motion phenomena. I am inspired by beauty and aesthetics in scientific phenomena.
