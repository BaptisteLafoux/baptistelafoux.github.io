## WIND my ROOF

WIND my ROOF is a startup I co-founded in 2019 with 2 friends from engineering school. 

**WIND my ROOF** provides low-carbon electricity to flat-roof buildings (malls, storage buildings, large housing) thanks to the **WindBox**, a low-tech, plug-and-play module. This 2 times 1 meter box combines a **horizontal axis wind turbine** that benefits from the wind acceleration due to the edge of the roof, and a solar panel.

## Why you should use ```Xarray```
Why should use the ```Xarray``` module if you are a physicist using python with large, multidimensional data ? See > [here](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/getting-started-guide/why-xarray.html)
