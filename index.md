I am a fluid mechanics researcher with expertise in experimental methods and data analysis. I currently work at D-ICE engineering (Nantes, France) as an R&D engineer.

## Background

I was from November 2020 to December 2023 a PhD student at the [**PMMH laboratory**](https://www.pmmh.espci.fr/?-Le-laboratoire-) (ESPCI - PSL, UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ© & Sorbonne UniversitÃ©).
I was part of the **Biomimetics and Fluid-Structure Interaction team** (aka [BIOMIM](https://www.pmmh.espci.fr/Biomimetics-and-Fluid-Structure-Interaction)), under the supervision of [Benjamin Thiria](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=Ho7KLfUAAAAJ&hl=fr) and [Ramiro Godoy-Diana](https://blog.espci.fr/ramiro/).

## Research Interests

- Fluid mechanics & fluid-structure interactions
- Geophysical flows
- Bio-inspired propulsion & energy harvesting
- Active matter & collective motion phenomena
- Data-driven approaches to complex systems
